# Pacman game
*The goal is to calculate the shortest distance between Ghost and PacMan*

The code uses BFS algorithms to calculate the distances
<!-- AT the beginning, take out the places inside the board of Gozetti and Pac Man
And then the distance is checked for each of them according to BFS algorithms
And then the results are put into a dictionary and sorted
-->
The algorithms of BFS:
In the beginning, two new auxiliary panels are built:
1- of the places if we reached them while running
2- of the distances, what is the distance of each cell from the pacman
